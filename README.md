SOAP adapter for Appcelerator Titanium Alloy
==========================
Finally you have full support of SOAP client into Titanium, depend on the power of [SOAP Node.js package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/soap).

This adaptor forked from [@Viezel Rest adapter](https://github.com/viezel/napp.alloy.adapter.restapi).

## How To Use

Add the [ti-soap](http://gitt.io/component/soap) commonjs module
```
gittio install soap
```

Download [soap.js](soap.js) to `PROJECT_FOLDER/app/assets/alloy/sync/` or use NPM thanks to [appc-npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/appc-npm):

```
npm install alloy-sync-soap --save
```

Add the following to your model in `PROJECT_FOLDER/app/models/foo.js`.
```
	exports.definition = {	
		config: {
			//"debug": 1, 
			"adapter": {
				"type": "soap",
				"collection_name": "MyCollection",
				"idAttribute": "id"
			},
			"headers": {},
	        	soapMethod: "catalogCategoryLevel",
	        	"parentNode": "news.domestic" //your root node
		},		
		extendModel: function(Model) {		
			_.extend(Model.prototype, {});
			return Model;
		},	
		extendCollection: function(Collection) {		
			_.extend(Collection.prototype, {});
			return Collection;
		}		
	}
```
Create the soap controller in Alloy.js
```
// Set SOAP global objects
Alloy.Globals.soap = {
	client: null,
	session: null,
	create: function( callback ) {

		var SOAP = require( 'soap' );
		SOAP.createClient( "http://example.com/wsdl.xml", function( err, client ) {

			Alloy.Globals.soap.client = client;

			Alloy.Globals.soap.client.login( {
				apiKey: "XXXXXXXX",
				username: "XXXXXXXXXX"
			}, function( err, result ) {
				if( !err ) {
					Alloy.Globals.soap.session = result.loginReturn.$value;
					callback( );
				} else {
					Ti.API.error( "[SOAP API] " + err );
				}
			} );

		} );
	}
};
```
